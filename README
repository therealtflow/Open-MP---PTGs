in practicing parallizing different c programs using openmp, i started with a simple helloworld program
    that uses openmp to run multiple different threads of the same print statement

in using openmp for reduction in the pi.c program, i added the openmp imports to the file and from there 
    added capabilities for using slurm that would allow me to see the completion time of the program, 
    checking if the parallizing was actually helpfull

    I found (as seen in the pi.out file) that using reduction, and 4 tnreads instead of one, the programs
        completion time could be almost 1.5 times faster than its original completion time using one 
        thread. 

through the PTG problem set I was able to visually depict the task graphs for each problem and the possible
    list scheduling and LPT scheduling tables that a computer would create computing these problems.
